# Karpov.Courses_projects
Hi!

There are some projects which I've made on Karpov.Courses data analytics in this repository.

Here you can see and evaluate my progress and skills of analyzing data, style and correctness of code.

A short description of the projects:
In the python folder you can see the first steps in analytics: working with pandas, APIs and visualization libraries
There is an example of working with ETL in the SQL folder 
There are testing hypotheses and working with the scipy and numpy libraries in the Statistics folder 

The repository will be updated as the course progresses.

Thanks for watching and goodluck!
